The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.

A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
A value of 0 is completely transparent.

  .sampleLinks {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
    opacity: 0.7;
  }
